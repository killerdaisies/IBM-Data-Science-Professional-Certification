**Defining Terms:**

Big Data: 

- data sets that are so massive, so quickly built, and so varied that they defy traditional analysis methods such as you might perform with a relational database.
- Often described in terms of five V's; velocity, volume, variety, veracity, and value. 

Data Mining:

- the process of automatically searching and analyzing data, discovering previously unrevealed patterns.
- It involves preprocessing the data to prepare it and transforming it into an appropriate formatinsights and patterns are then mined and extracted using various tools and techniques ranging from simple data visualization tools to machine learning and statistical models.

Machine Learning:

- Machine learning is a subset of AI that uses computer algorithms to analyze data and make intelligent decisions based on what it is learned without being explicitly programmed trained with large sets of data and do not follow rules-based algorithmsenables machines to solve problems on their own and make accurate predictions using the provided data.

Deep Learning: 

- Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses layered neural networks to simulate human decision-making
- Deep learning algorithms can label and categorize information and identify patternsAI systems to continuously learn on the job and improve the quality and accuracy of results by determining whether decisions were correct

Neural network: 

- take inspiration from biological neural networks
- A neural network in AI is a collection of small computing units called neurons that take incoming data and learn to make decisions over time
- Neural networks are often layer-deep and are the reason deep learning algorithms become more efficient as the data sets increase in volume, as opposed to other machine learning algorithms that may plateau as data increases.



**Artificial intelligence VS data science** 

Data Science is a broad term that encompasses the entire data processing methodology while AI includes everything that allows computers to learn how to solve problems and make intelligent decisions. 

Both involve use of big data

Data Science is the process and method for extracting knowledge and insights from large volumes of disparate data. It's an interdisciplinary field involving mathematics, statistical analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and more

Makes it possible for us to appropriate information, see patterns, find meaning from large volumes of data and use it to make decisions that drive business.

Can use many of the AI techniques to derive insight from data e.g. machine learning algorithms and even deep learning models to extract meaning and draw inferences from data.
